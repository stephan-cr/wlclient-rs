Wlclient
========

Overview
--------

[Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) client, which directly
talks to the underlying [Wayland low-level
protocol](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/apa.html#protocol-spec-wl_display).

The goal of this project is to understand the low-level details of
Wayland. Furthermore, it build on top of [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/),
because Wayland is asynchronous by nature.
